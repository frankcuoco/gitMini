# gitMini Version Control System

This is a *lite* version of Git I created in Java that I made for the final project in CS 61B: Data Structures.
In it, I made a detailed design document to ultimately implement the following commands through my
chosen design: init, add, commit, rm, log, global-log, find, status, checkout, branch, rm-branch, reset, and merge.
I also ensured expected behavior through a thorough testing suite.
